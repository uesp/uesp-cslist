Database connections:

  csread_conn.inc read/write 	used by csread when reading .esm's to update
			       	database
  csdata_conn.inc read		used by webfrontend to read data

For Skyrim, the database CSData_SRData is used.

==============================================================================
Updating database:

  csread.php is invoked manually to update the database. It needs to be edited
  to refelect the job at hand. To add the data of a new file, the version
  found at examples/csread.addfile.php can be used. Steps that need to be
  done:

    * Copy the .esm and string files to the cs_input directory.
    * Add definitions for the new file to the end of the arrays
      in srread.inc .
    * Call "php csread.php", the new file will be automatically
      detected and data for it added. This works only for the first
      time the script is invoked after addding new file definitions
      to srread.inc .

  Currently only Skyrim data can be added, Morrowind and Oblivion data
  would need minor changes in the code. It is probably a bad idea to
  add missing Update versions out of order (and probably not important
  anyway).
